# Crashdows
Crashdows crashes most versions of Windows using \\.GLOBALROOT\Device\ConDrv\**** (censored so it does not crash your device), C:\con\con or terminating wininit.exe.
Doesn't have lots of uses, but it works!
Compile using Visual Studio 2019, but it might work in 2021. And with some tweakes, should compile in 2003, so you can actually run it in Windows 98.
